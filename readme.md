# SVGArt

Experiments with generative art with SVG and animation.

All source code is contained in the HTML file. 
There is no 
compilation and the javascript source is designed
to be read using the web-browser's source view.

#### Demo

<https://boscoh.github.io/svgart>

#### Dependencies

Inline run-time [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is used to manage the DOM.

Sprite animation is written to canvas using a 
small in-house sprite manager.
